Generate a video animation of the evolution over time of the field described by the given input file. Using PyPy3 for the `generate_data.py` script is recommended since it runs way faster than with CPython.

	$ ./generate_data.py example.in Nframes
	$ ./generate_animation.py

Using Python + PIL for this kind of stuff is probably insane, but you know... I like it the hard way. Thanks to my best friend Mattyw for helping me create the sprites for the animation.
