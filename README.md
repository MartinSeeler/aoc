About Advent of Code
--------------------

[Advent of Code][aoc-about] is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after the first is solved). If you like the project and want to support it, you can [donate here][aoc-support].

I discovered Advent of Code in 2017, and played my first edition in 2018.


About this repo
---------------

In this repository you can find my solutions for the puzzles as well as other miscellaneus stuff like visualizations and other helper scripts. Original solutions are provided almost unedited, and are the ones which I wrote to solve the puzzle for the first time. Additional "clean" versions were refined and optimized later. I chose to upload original versions for two reasons: they are a good and fun way to see how I code, and they can be uploaded as soon as the puzzle is solved (I often don't have time to rewrite them more cleanly).


Solutions by year
-----------------

Here you can find quick links the solutions for each year. Ideally, I will update these two links to point to a detailed README with a walkthrough for each year's solutions when/if I find the time.
